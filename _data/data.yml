    The skills section in a resume is a dedicated section where you can list out the various skills that you possess that are relevant to the job you are applying for. This section allows you to highlight your strengths and demonstrate your capabilities to potential employers.

    The skills section can include both hard skills and soft skills. Hard skills are specific technical abilities or knowledge related to a particular job or industry, such as proficiency in programming languages or experience with certain software programs. Soft skills are more general personal traits and abilities, such as communication skills, leadership, problem-solving, or teamwork.

    When crafting your skills section, it's important to tailor it to the specific job you are applying for, and only include skills that are relevant to the position. This can help catch the attention of the hiring manager and demonstrate that you have the qualifications necessary to succeed in the role.

    There are multiple ways to present your skills here. One way is to show them in a rating format. Another way is to group them together. Alternatively, you can use markdown to format it in a way that you prefer.

    The education section in a resume is where you provide information about your academic background, including any degrees. In this section, you should include the name and location of the institution where you received your degree, the name of the degree or program you completed, and the date of graduation. If you have earned multiple degrees, list them in reverse chronological order, with the most recent degree first.

    In addition to basic information about your education, you may also want to include any academic honors or awards you received, relevant coursework or projects, and your GPA if it is 3.0 or above. If you have recently graduated and do not have much work experience yet, highlighting your education and academic achievements can help demonstrate your potential to succeed in the workplace.
